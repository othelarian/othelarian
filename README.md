- 👋 Hi, I’m @othelarian
- 👔 I'm a former tech engineer, mostly for bank, but not only, and now I'm product owner
- 👀 I’m interested in rust, wasm, coffeescript, and webapp
- 🌱 I’m currently experimenting liveScript, while keeping wasm and Bevy in a corner of my head
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing right now, I'm busy with my own projects, but if you want to contribute to one of my projects feel free to reach me
- 📫 How to reach me: by mail (I'm sure you can find it ;-) ), or via a MR
