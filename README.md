- 👋 Hi, I’m @othelarian
- 👔 I'm a former tech engineer, mostly for bank, but not only, and now I'm product owner
- 👀 I’m interested in rust, wasm, CoffeeScript, and webapps
- 🌱 I’m currently experimenting LiveScript, while keeping wasm and Bevy in a corner of my head
- ⚙️ I'm also working on small projects, like minigames, exploring canvas a bit, and maybe some 3D stuff
- 📫 How to reach me: by mail (I'm sure you can find it ;-) ), or via a MR
